abstract = {A second high current accelerator of 400kV has been installed at the underground laboratory of Gran Sasso, called LUNA II. We describe this new facility as well as measurements of the proton beam characteristics: absolute energy, energy spread, and long-term energy stability. The absolute energy was determined to a precision of ±300eV at Ep=130–400keV using the energy of the capture γ-ray transition of 12C(p,γ)13N as well as resonance energies at Ep=309–389keV of 23Na(p,γ)24Mg, 26Mg(p,γ)27Al, and 25Mg(p,γ)26Al. The resonance studies led to a proton energy spread of better than 100eV and a long-term energy stability of 5eV per hour.}

abstract = {The geometrical location of a narrow resonance within an extended gas target moves along the beam axis as the beam energy is varied. This location changes however for a constant gas target pressure, if the ion beam intensity is varied. It is also found, that - for a constant ion beam current - the expected location differs from that observed as the gas pressure is increased. It is concluded, that the gas target densities along the beam axis depend on both the energy loss per unit length and the ion beam current, i.e. the dissipated power in the gas. This dissipated power increases in turn the temperature of the target gas. Effects greater than 10% are seen for dissipated powers greater than 20 mW/mm. The effects have been studied at the Ep = 278 keV resonance of the 14N(p, γ)15 O reaction.}

abstract = {The direct capture process in the reactions 21Ne(p, γ)22Na and 22Ne(p, γ)23Na has been investigated at Ep = 0.3–1.6 MeV using neon gas enriched to 91 % in 21Ne and to 99 % in 22Ne, respectively. The gas was recirculated in a differentially pumped gas target system of the extended-static and quasi-point supersonic jet type. For 22Ne(p, γ)23Na, the direct capture process has been observed to several final states in 23Na up to Ex = 8.83 MeV excitation energy. The deduced spectroscopic factors C2S are in fair agreement with the corresponding values from stripping reactions. The capture transition into the 23Na ground state exhibits broad structures, which resemble Ericson fluctuations. The data remove the previously reported discrepancies in C2S for the 23Na ground state. The excitation functions for the 21Ne(p, γ)22Na reaction are dominated by broad and intense resonances, which hampered the measurement of the direct capture process. The nuclear and astrophysical aspects of the results are discussed.}
